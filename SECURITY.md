## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique API keys
   - Regularly rotate credentials
   - Limit API key permissions when possible

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Consider using proxy servers for additional privacy
   - Monitor network traffic for anomalies

3. **System Security**
   - Keep Python and dependencies updated
   - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
   - Run with minimal required privileges
   - Regular security scans of dependencies

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use secure database configurations
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular backups with encryption

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Use type hints and validation
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use dependency scanning tools
   - Review security advisories
   - Pin dependency versions

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests in CI/CD
   - Test with different privilege levels
   - Validate input sanitization
   - Test error conditions

## Known Security Considerations

### Browser Automation
- **Risk**: Browser instances may retain sensitive data
- **Mitigation**: Automatic cleanup and stealth browsing mode
- **Best Practice**: Use headless mode in production

### API Keys and Credentials
- **Risk**: Exposure of API keys in logs or memory
- **Mitigation**: Secure credential handling and masking in logs
- **Best Practice**: Use environment variables and credential rotation

### Web Scraping
- **Risk**: Potentially accessing malicious websites
- **Mitigation**: URL validation and content sanitization
- **Best Practice**: Use allowlists for trusted domains when possible

### LLM Integration
- **Risk**: Prompt injection and data leakage
- **Mitigation**: Input validation and output filtering
- **Best Practice**: Use local LLMs when handling sensitive data

### Database Storage
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to research data
- **Mitigation**: Encrypted storage and access controls
- **Best Practice**: Regular security audits and monitoring

### Configuration Security

```bash
# Secure environment configuration
DEBUG=false                    # Disable debug mode in production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                # Avoid verbose logging in production
BROWSER_HEADLESS=true         # Use headless mode for security
CACHE_ENABLED=true            # Enable caching for performance
DATABASE_ECHO=false           # Disable SQL query logging
```

### Monitoring and Alerting
