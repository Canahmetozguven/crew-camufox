## Usage Guide

### Basic Flow Execution

```python
from src.workflows.flows_v2 import EnhancedResearchFlowV2

# Create and initialize flow
flow = EnhancedResearchFlowV2()

# Define research context
context = {
    "query": "AI advancements in 2024",
    "execution_mode": "parallel",
    "priority": 3,
    "max_parallel_steps": 4,
    "search_terms": ["artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "2024"],
    "depth_level": 3,
    "quality_threshold": 0.8
}

# Execute flow phases
init_result = flow.initialize_enhanced_flow(context)
planning_result = flow.dynamic_planning_phase(init_result)

# Route execution based on complexity
execution_route = flow.execution_strategy_router(planning_result)

if execution_route == "deep_analysis_execution":
    execution_result = flow.deep_analysis_execution(planning_result)
elif execution_route == "parallel_execution":
    execution_result = flow.parallel_execution(planning_result)
else:
    execution_result = flow.standard_execution(planning_result)

# Synthesis and finalization
synthesis_result = flow.intelligent_synthesis(execution_result)
final_result = flow.quality_assurance_and_finalization(synthesis_result)
```

### Integration with Existing Templates

```python
from src.workflows.flow_integration import EnhancedWorkflowManager
from src.templates.research_templates import AcademicResearchTemplate

# Create enhanced manager
manager = EnhancedWorkflowManager()

# Create research template
template = AcademicResearchTemplate()

# Execute with automatic method selection
result = manager.execute_template(template)  # Auto-selects best method

# Force specific execution method
traditional_result = manager.execute_template(template, use_flows_v2=False)
flows_result = manager.execute_template(template, use_flows_v2=True)

# Compare execution methods
comparison = manager.compare_execution_methods(template)
print(f"Recommended: {comparison['execution_recommendations']['recommended_method']}")
```

### Workflow Composition

```python
from src.workflows.flows_v2 import FlowOrchestrator, WorkflowComposition

orchestrator = FlowOrchestrator()

# Create multiple flows
research_flow = EnhancedResearchFlowV2()
analysis_flow = EnhancedResearchFlowV2()
synthesis_flow = EnhancedResearchFlowV2()

# Compose workflows
composition_id = orchestrator.compose_workflows(
    research_flow, analysis_flow, synthesis_flow,
    composition_type="sequential"
)

# Execute composition
result = await orchestrator.execute_composition(
    composition_id, 
    {"query": "Complex research topic"}
)
```

### Event Handling

```python
from src.workflows.flows_v2 import FlowEvent, FlowEventType

def flow_monitor(event: FlowEvent):
    print(f"Event: {event.event_type.value} in flow {event.flow_id}")
    if event.step_name:
        print(f"  Step: {event.step_name}")

# Add event listeners
flow.add_event_listener(FlowEventType.FLOW_STARTED, flow_monitor)
flow.add_event_listener(FlowEventType.STEP_COMPLETED, flow_monitor)
flow.add_event_listener(FlowEventType.STEP_FAILED, flow_monitor)
```

### State Management and Checkpoints

```python
# Create checkpoint
flow.create_checkpoint("before_analysis")

# Continue execution...

# Restore if needed
if error_occurred:
    flow.restore_checkpoint("before_analysis")
```

## Configuration Options

### Flow Execution Modes

- **SEQUENTIAL**: Steps execute one after another
- **PARALLEL**: Independent steps execute simultaneously
- **ADAPTIVE**: Dynamic mode selection based on complexity
- **HYBRID**: Mix of sequential and parallel execution

### Flow Priorities

- **LOW** (1): Background processing
- **NORMAL** (2): Standard research tasks
- **HIGH** (3): Important research projects
- **CRITICAL** (4): Urgent, high-priority tasks

### Migration Configuration

```python
from src.workflows.flow_integration import FlowMigrationConfig

config = FlowMigrationConfig(
    preserve_legacy_behavior=True,
    enable_advanced_features=True,
    fallback_to_traditional=True,
    monitoring_enabled=True,
    cache_enabled=True
)
```

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Execution

Flows 2.0 automatically determines optimal parallel execution based on:
- Step dependencies
- Resource availability
- Complexity analysis
- Historical performance data

### Caching

Advanced caching strategies include:
- Result caching for identical queries
- Intermediate step caching
- Cross-flow result sharing
- Intelligent cache invalidation

### Resource Management

- Dynamic resource allocation
- Load balancing across parallel streams
- Memory usage optimization
- Timeout and retry management

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Flow Metrics

```python
# Get real-time analytics
analytics = flow.get_execution_analytics()

print(f"Flow ID: {analytics['flow_id']}")
print(f"Progress: {analytics['progress']['progress_percentage']:.1f}%")
print(f"Performance: {analytics['performance']['steps_per_minute']:.1f} steps/min")
print(f"Error Rate: {analytics['performance']['error_rate']:.1%}")
```

### Execution History

```python
# Get execution analytics
manager_analytics = manager.get_execution_analytics()

print(f"Total Executions: {manager_analytics['total_executions']}")
print(f"Flows 2.0 Usage: {manager_analytics['execution_distribution']['flows_v2_percentage']:.1f}%")
print(f"Success Rate: {manager_analytics['performance_metrics']['success_rate']:.1%}")
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Automatic Recovery

- **Retry Logic**: Failed steps are automatically retried with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Execution**: Flows 2.0 failures automatically fall back to traditional workflows
- **Checkpoint Recovery**: Failed flows can be restored from the last successful checkpoint
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with reduced functionality if components fail

### Error Events

```python
def error_handler(event: FlowEvent):
    if event.event_type == FlowEventType.STEP_FAILED:
        print(f"Step {event.step_name} failed: {event.data.get('error')}")
        print(f"Retry count: {event.data.get('retry_count')}")

flow.add_event_listener(FlowEventType.STEP_FAILED, error_handler)
```

## Integration Patterns

### Template Migration

Existing research templates automatically benefit from Flows 2.0:

1. **Automatic Detection**: System determines if template should use Flows 2.0
2. **Context Conversion**: Templates are converted to flow contexts
3. **Pattern Mapping**: Traditional patterns are mapped to flow execution modes
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality is preserved

### API Compatibility

```python
# Existing code continues to work
from src.templates.workflow_patterns import WorkflowManager

manager = WorkflowManager()  # Traditional manager
enhanced_manager = EnhancedWorkflowManager()  # Enhanced with Flows 2.0

# Both support the same interface
result1 = manager.optimize_workflow(template)
result2 = enhanced_manager.execute_template(template)
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Flows 2.0

Use Flows 2.0 for:
- Complex research projects (difficulty ≥ 3)
- Long-running workflows (duration ≥ 30 minutes)
- Multi-step processes (≥ 4 steps)
- Time-critical research
- Projects requiring monitoring

### When to Use Traditional Workflows

Use traditional workflows for:
- Simple, single-step tasks
- Quick prototype research
- Legacy system integration
- Resource-constrained environments

### Performance Tips

1. **Leverage Parallel Execution**: Design steps to be as independent as possible
2. **Use Checkpoints**: Create checkpoints before expensive operations
3. **Monitor Events**: Use event listeners for real-time monitoring
4. **Cache Results**: Enable caching for repeated operations
5. **Optimize Context**: Provide detailed context for better routing decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure CrewAI Flows 2.0 is properly installed
2. **Fallback Behavior**: System automatically falls back to traditional workflows
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage with large workflows
4. **Event Handler Errors**: Ensure event handlers don't throw exceptions

### Debug Mode

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging
logging.getLogger('src.workflows').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Monitor flow execution
flow_logger = logging.getLogger('src.workflows.flows_v2')
flow_logger.info("Flow execution started")
```

### Performance Debugging

```python
# Get detailed performance metrics
analytics = flow.get_execution_analytics()
print(f"Execution time: {analytics['performance']['execution_time']:.2f}s")
print(f"Cache hit rate: {analytics.get('cache_hit_rate', 0):.1%}")
print(f"Parallel efficiency: {analytics.get('parallel_efficiency', 0):.1%}")
```
