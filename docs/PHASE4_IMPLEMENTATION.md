**Purpose**: Pre-defined research templates and workflow patterns for various research scenarios.

**Components**:
- **`research_templates.py`**: Core template system with 5 built-in templates
- **`workflow_patterns.py`**: 4 execution patterns for optimal research workflows

**Built-in Templates**:
1. **Academic Research**: Peer-reviewed sources, literature review, gap analysis
2. **Market Research**: Market landscape, competitive analysis, consumer insights  
3. **Competitive Analysis**: Competitor profiling, strategy analysis, SWOT
4. **News Research**: Current events, fact verification, timeline construction
5. **Technical Research**: Specifications, implementation patterns, documentation

**Workflow Patterns**:
1. **Linear**: Sequential execution with dependency resolution
2. **Deep Dive**: Iterative refinement with quality gates
3. **Comparative**: Parallel comparison with synthesis
4. **Trend Analysis**: Temporal analysis with pattern recognition

```python
# Example Usage
from src.templates.research_templates import ResearchTemplateManager, TemplateType
from src.templates.workflow_patterns import WorkflowManager

template_manager = ResearchTemplateManager()
workflow_manager = WorkflowManager()

# Get academic research template
template = template_manager.get_template(TemplateType.ACADEMIC)

# Optimize workflow with deep dive pattern
optimized_workflow = workflow_manager.optimize_workflow(template, PatternType.DEEP_DIVE)

# Estimate execution time
estimated_time = workflow_manager.estimate_workflow_time(template)
```

### 2. Source Verification System (`src/verification/`)

**Purpose**: Advanced source verification with credibility assessment, bias detection, and cross-referencing.

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-algorithm verification**: Authority, accuracy, objectivity, currency, coverage
- **Bias detection**: Political, commercial, confirmation, authority, recency bias
- **Source classification**: Academic, news, government, corporate, social media
- **Cross-reference validation**: Fact-checking and claim verification
- **Credibility scoring**: 5-level credibility assessment (Very Low to Very High)

```python
# Example Usage
from src.verification import SourceVerifier, CredibilityLevel

verifier = SourceVerifier()

# Verify single source
result = await verifier.verify_source(
    url="https://nature.com/article",
    content="Peer-reviewed research paper content..."
)

print(f"Credibility: {result.credibility_level}")
print(f"Score: {result.credibility_score}")
print(f"Detected biases: {result.detected_biases}")

# Batch verification
sources = [
    ("https://reuters.com/news", "News content"),
    ("https://university.edu/paper", "Academic paper")
]
results = await verifier.batch_verify_sources(sources)

# Generate summary
summary = verifier.get_verification_summary(results)
```

### 3. Enhanced Research Flow (`src/workflows/`)

3. **Data Collection**: Multi-agent parallel source gathering
4. **Verification**: Quality-based verification routing
5. **Synthesis**: Content integration and analysis
6. **Finalization**: Report generation and quality assurance

```python
# Example Usage
from src.workflows import EnhancedResearchFlow, ResearchContext

flow = EnhancedResearchFlow()

# Create research context

    mission_id="research_001",
    query="Impact of AI on healthcare",
    scope="comprehensive analysis",
    quality_threshold=0.8,
    enable_verification=True
)

# Execute research flow
result = flow.initialize_research(context)
planning_result = flow.planning_phase(result)
collection_result = flow.data_collection_phase(planning_result)

# Get current state
current_state = flow.get_current_state()
print(f"Progress: {current_state['progress_percentage']}%")
```

- **Task Coordination**: Skill-based assignment with load balancing
- **Peer Review System**: Automated review workflow with consensus
- **Knowledge Management**: Shared knowledge base with version control
- **Team Metrics**: Performance tracking and collaboration analytics

**Collaboration Types**:
- **Distributed**: Multiple researchers on different aspects
- **Parallel**: Multiple researchers on same topic
- **Sequential**: Handoff between researchers
- **Peer Review**: Review and validation workflow
- **Crowdsourced**: Community-driven research

```python
# Example Usage
from src.collaboration import (
    CollaborationOrchestrator, Researcher, ResearchRole, CollaborationType
)

orchestrator = CollaborationOrchestrator()

# Create collaborative project
project = orchestrator.create_project(
    "AI Healthcare Research",
    "Collaborative study on AI in healthcare",
    CollaborationType.DISTRIBUTED
)

# Add team members
lead_researcher = Researcher(
    id="lead_001",
    name="Dr. Sarah Johnson",
    role=ResearchRole.LEAD_RESEARCHER,
    specializations=["artificial intelligence", "healthcare"]
)

specialist = Researcher(
    id="specialist_001", 
    name="Dr. Mike Chen",
    role=ResearchRole.SPECIALIST,
    specializations=["machine learning", "medical devices"]
)

orchestrator.add_researcher(project.id, lead_researcher)
orchestrator.add_researcher(project.id, specialist)

# Create and assign tasks
task_id = orchestrator.create_task(
    project.id,
    "AI Diagnostics Analysis",
    "Analyze AI applications in medical diagnostics",
    research_area="artificial intelligence",
    priority=1
)

# Complete task and initiate review
findings = {
    "results": "AI shows 95% accuracy in diagnostic imaging",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "methodology": "Systematic literature review"
}

orchestrator.complete_task(project.id, task_id, findings)

# Get project status
status = orchestrator.get_project_status(project.id)
print(f"Progress: {status['progress_percentage']}%")
print(f"Team efficiency: {status['team_metrics']['team_efficiency']}")
```
